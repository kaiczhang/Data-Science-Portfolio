## Here are some projects I have done during my time as a Master of Science in Business Anaytics Student at UT Austin


### [1. NLP - Beer Reccomendation System;](https://github.com/kaiczhang/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Beer%20Recommendation%20System.ipynb)
In this project I created building blocks of a crowdsourced recommender system. It accepts user inputs in the form of desired attributes of a product and come up with 3 recommendations. 

Techniques used: Bag of Words, VADER Sentiment Analysis, SpaCy Word Embedding, Lift Association, Cosine Similarity

### [2. Classification - Predictive Maintenance on Manufacturing Equipment;](https://github.com/kaiczhang/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Predictive%20Maintenance%20on%20Manufacturing%20Equipment.ipynb)
In the manufactoing industry, an unexpected machine failure can be costly. Even one machine can cause the entire production line to hault. This goal of this binary classification project is to determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to estimate when maintenance should be performed.

Techniques used: K-nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistics Regression, Data Wrangling, Data Visualization

### [3. Classification/NLP - Spam Message Classification;](https://github.com/kaiczhang/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/SpamProject.ipynb)
The objective of this project is to explore and compare different natural language processing and classification methods of detecting spam messages.

Techniques used: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Topic Modeling, Tf-Idf Vectorizing, Word Embedding, Logistics Regression, Random Forest, Cosine Similarity

### 4. Optimization - Picking Stocks for Index Fund;
Techniques used: Gurobi, Integer Programming, Linear & Non-linear Optimization

### 5. NLP - Car Models and Brands; 
Techniques used: Beautifulsoup, Zipf's law,Lift Chart, Multi-dimensional Scaling(MDS) Map, Word Tokenization

### 6. Linear Regression/Regression Tree - Outlet Sales;
Techniques used: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Cross Validation, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization
